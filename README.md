# 🔥 Portfolio Terminal - Hack Your Way Through My World 🌐

Welcome to my portfolio, but not just any portfolio—a command-line interface (CLI) experience inspired by the smooth precision of Kali Linux and the iconic flair of Apple. This isn't your ordinary website; it's a playground where you can navigate my world like a pro hacker, all while enjoying the elegance of a designer's touch.

## 🚀 Features

- **Kali Linux-Style CLI**: Step into the shoes of a pentester. Type commands, explore directories, and feel like you're breaking into a system—except you're diving into my work.
- **Apple Window Aesthetics**: Because who said a terminal can't be beautiful? Smooth gradients, refined fonts, and a minimalist design that pays homage to Apple's clean interface.
- **Interactive Navigation**: Forget clicking around; interact with my portfolio by typing commands. It’s functional, fast, and fun.
- **Easter Eggs**: Hidden commands and surprises—if you can find them. 

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Fire Up the Terminal**: Open the website, and you're instantly in a terminal environment. 
2. **Explore with Commands**: Use commands like `ls`, `cd`, and `cat` to navigate and uncover what I've been up to.
3. **Dig Deeper**: Want to see my projects? Just type `projects` and get a detailed list. Curious about me? `whoami` has you covered.
4. **Experience the UI**: While you’re at it, enjoy the smooth, responsive design that transitions seamlessly between elements—like hacking, but make it fashion.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Built with the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—custom tailored for a terminal-like experience.
- **Design**: Meticulously crafted with Figma, keeping in mind the delicate balance between a hacker's workspace and a designer's studio.
- **Hosting**: Deployed on Vercel for a fast, reliable, and secure experience.

## 🐱‍💻 Behind the Code

Why just view the source? Interact with it. This portfolio is as much a showcase of my work as it is an invitation to experience it hands-on. Every line of code, every design decision, has been made to reflect not just what I do, but how I do it.
